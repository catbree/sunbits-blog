It's been awhile.

## I'm back after an unplanned hiatus.

When Sunbits was first created, I envisioned it to be a consistently updated living journal of my learnings and progress. If you look at my past posts.. well.. it didn't turn out that way.

What started off as a new adventure quickly turned into something that I dreaded. My experiences didn't feel worthy for the internet. Writing was also difficult, it felt impossible to express something in my head through pictures and words.

I struggled badly.

But not too long ago, I read a short and sweet book called [_Show Your Work_ by Austin Cleon](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/). He summarised the book with these 10 points:

![Show Your Work](/images/sunbits-1.1.0-update-show-your-work.jpeg)

Since this isn't a book review, I won't get into the details. But I've decided to take some of his advices (as well as ignore some others kek). I created this cozy little corner so I could carve out a little space of the internet for myself. It may take awhile and it may be in short snippets, but I'm back so **hello again!**
## 1.1.0 Updates to Sunbits

Okay, enough with the feels. I made some updates to my blog. 

### Videos and Gifs
My posts are written in Hugo in Markdown so I hadn't been able to post videos. In my second post, [Spotify's Fan Study](/posts/spotify-fan-study), I realised a need for it when I was trying to show an interaction but couldn't do it. ðŸ˜¢ It uses a [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) which I learnt from [this post by Sorush Khajepor](https://iamsorush.com/posts/add-video-to-hugo-post/).

As a demonstration, here's a gif of a game that I'm currently obsessed with.

### About page
I also added a new page. To be honest, there's really no use-case for it except for my urge to show anyone this cute drawing I did of Rabbit holding a sunflower. Yes, the white syrian hamster is called _Rabbit_.

You can navigate to it using the main navigation bar. But for the lazy, [here you go](/about).

### Sunbits logo animation
Last but not least, a completely unnecessary update to animate the Sunbits icon. Because, why the heck not? I'd love to show a code snippet, except code blocks aren't styled yet. 

Which brings me to the last part of this post.

## Moving forward from here

I'll focus on writing shorter and more informal posts to reduce the amount of effort it takes to get a post out. At this point, I'd like to get comfortable with publishing something of my own, rather than perfecting a piece that never gets to see the light of day.

I'd also like to use a library for code blocks. I found a library called highlight.js but am still in the process of figuring out how it works. 

Happy days ahead!
