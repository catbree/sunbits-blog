I came across Spotify's Fan Study the other day - it shared a set of data-driven insights about the behaviours of Spotify Users and how artists can act upon them. I found it interesting and thought I'd share a short reflection piece about this website.

There are numerous advocates for [boring UX](https://ux.shopify.com/in-defence-of-boring-ux-ad32acd4d437) nowadays — a lot of work lies behind the curtains for for us to deliver simple and straightforward content to our users. I do agree largely with this view, though sometimes it's cathartic to stumble upon a website that challenges this notion while  still satisfying a need and being useful.

## What is Fan Study by Spotify?

The Spotify team has always been pretty well-known for their marketing stunts. This [Fan Study](https://fanstudy.byspotify.com/) was published on 20 May 2021 for Spotify artists. It released 15 key insights backed by data-driven research and touched on how fans (Spotify's way of calling everyday listeners like you and me) listen to music and connect with their favourite artists. With each insight, there was a clear CTA - an actionable step that artists can take to grow their fanbase.

Immediately, it was very clear what the site's purpose is and who it was for.

## Notables

### Clear Structure

Right off the bat, the website kept repeating: 15 insights, segmented into four themes. Clear signposts and transitions were around to let users know when they're finishing a theme and entering another one. Almost no getting lost here!

There is also a really clear flow, which can be summarised in this way: Index → Specific Insight → Don't believe? View data. → Actionable step.

For a Spotify artist, the site's usefulness comes from: gaining newfound insights backed by evidence, and acquiring useful tools to build their fanbase.

### The primary button wants you to click it.

We've seen all sorts of primary buttons... solid ones, glowing ones, moving ones, flashing ones, but have you seen one that literally follows you across the screen? Well, maybe- but it's been long since I've experience one unironically.

> Please click me. — primary button probably

### Abstract patterns I didn't get

The animations are smooth (on desktop) and satisfying as they morphed across the screen while I scrolled through the insights. But even though they piqued my interest, I didn't understand them. I made no connections with the abstract patterns, even though it was a key element of the website.

What am I supposed to make out of this illustration...?

### Navigation wasn't immediately visible

While I was looking through the content, I wondered why there were no other methods of navigation apart from a manual scroll. Towards the end of my adventure, I found an inconspicuous dominoes icon at the top. It made sense after I clicked it, except its shape and animation looked very much like a sound wave. Not to mention, it only appears when I scroll up.

### Awkward and choppy mobile/tablet interactions

The Fan Study was highly responsive, with a lot of rearrangements done to ensure that it would look good on almost any platform. But the website proved to be a challenge to load on mobile, and the interactions were choppy.

You may also recall the CLICK ME button - what happens to that on mobile you ask? Well, it disappeared. Since there isn't a cursor to follow, it just shows as a normal button on smaller screens.

(a small thought in my mind - wouldn't it be fun if it was replaced by a slow-moving button that bounces around within the clickable area? like a bubble!)

## Why I wrote this Website Highlight

I enjoyed the balance of aesthetics and usability on this website. Despite some unconventional elements and over-the-top design, its clear IA and flow kept the website structured and straightforward to understand. It serves as a reminder to think outside of the box while still coming up with something that's highly usable and addresses the primary needs of our users. I hope to have a collection of similar websites that make me feel a certain way and come back to them in the future when my creative juices are lacking.
