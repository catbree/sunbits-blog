Have you ever looked at the spine of a library book and wondered how its call number was decided? Lucky for me, it was mentioned during work by a colleague of mine which led me into a small search on what it's about.

## What's a Dewey Decimal System?
The Dewey Decimal System (DDS) is a popular classification system used to arranged books and was created by Melvil Dewey in 1851.

In the past, books were organised chronologically in terms of when they were first added to the library. This resulted in browsing difficulties as books weren't ordered in a way that made sense to readers. With the introduction of the DDS, books were organised based on their subject and placed along with other similar books. 

Pretty cool, no? :3

## How it works
A book's call number is made up of three main sets of information and arranged in numerical & alphabetical order:
- The first three digits informs the **class**.
- The next three digits following the decimal informs the **division**.
- The three letters at the end informs the **author**.

Following the DDS scheme, there are 10 classes in total, each covering a large subject with an assigned code as shown below.

By design, the classification structure is hierarchical. Each digit to the right indicates a more specific topic of the preceding digit's topic. As such, books can be generalised if the numbers on the right are removed. Similarly, using more digits would indicate a more specific topic.

This example taken directly off [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) which was very helpful to showcase the idea above:
```
500 Natural sciences and mathematics
    510 Mathematics
        516 Geometry
            516.3 Analytic geometries
                516.37 Metric differential geometries
                    516.375 Finsler geometry
```

As additional examples, here are the call numbers of some books I've recently read.
- 530.0922 MLO - [Stephen Hawking: A Memoir of Friendship and Physics](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=204518160)
- 363.738747 GAT - [How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/WPAC/BIBENQ/261602175/334933159,3)
- 158 KIS - [The Courage to be Disliked](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/WPAC/BIBENQ/261626113/269028461,5)

## Bias
It's worth mentioning the system's flaws as well. The original DDS has been criticised to be racially biased. Not too long ago, LGTBQ+ topics have been parked under the categories such as Derangement and Abnormal Psychology. This situation has slowly evolved positively over time, with LGBTQ+ topics being housed more appropriated under 306.76. [A Brief History of Homophobia in Dewey Decimal Classsification](https://overland.org.au/2015/07/a-brief-history-of-homophobia-in-dewey-decimal-classification/) is an article that covers more details around DDS' racial biasness which is worth a read.

Other flaws include skewing towards christianity and away from women. While I won't be touching on these too much, it seemed like something I should acknowledge along with this article.

## Random thoughts
The DDS system has been revised through 23 major editions with the most recent version printed in 2011. While I haven't looked specifically into the specific changes over the years, I believe that there would be a correlation that reflects the world's focus during the time of change.

Additionally, I think it's pretty cool to see a real-world information architecture being used by so many in the world. It would be one my go-to examples when content hierarchy is mentioned in the future.
