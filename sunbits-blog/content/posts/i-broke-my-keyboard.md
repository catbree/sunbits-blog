and then I got a new one. It's been a rollercoaster ride.

## Sunbits Project update

In Jan I wrote about [Sunbits Project 2022](/posts/sunbits-project-2022) which was an experiment to work on my personal interests. It refreshes every month for the sake of exploration and testing. As you can guess from the title, I spent the last 3 months learning how to mod my keyboard.

The original plan of a 1-month stint quickly grew out of proportion because of a mistake I made a year ago (to be explained later).

This is a quick summary on the journey so far, but it won't be technical or academic of any sorts. Because while I've been enjoying this and adopted it as a side-hobby, I'd like to close out this chapter in order to start a new Sunbits Project!


## So what did I do for the past three months?

With zero knowledge of keyboard modding, it wasn't immediately obvious to me just how significant the abovementioned mistake was. For the unfamiliar, a hot-swappable keyboard allows you to quickly remove switches from its plate and PCB using a switch puller. This is much easier than the painstaking labourous process of desoldering your switches piece by piece. In order to solder, you need a 400 degree solder iron to melt solder into molten iron. It can then be sucked up by a desoldering pump.  Attached a picture of keyboard breakdown for reference!

At the time of purchase, I picked out a model that wasn't hot-swappable. As a result, I spent my first month gathering the tools and learnt how to deconstruct my keyboard. 

Here's an extremely rough note I did trying to recap my first month:

![Keyboard Mod Notes](/images/keyboard-mod-notion-notes.png)

I made a lot of mistakes and addressed them along the way. Until I made an irreversible error - I burnt the circuit tracks on my PCB. This caused an entire row of keys to malfunction. After multiple futile attempts at resolving the issue, a kind internet stranger offered to look into it for me. We couldn't figure out where the burnt track was... With a very heavy heart I said goodbye to Keebs and decommissioned it.

On the bright side, this pushed me to figure out a great deal of issues I faced. At this point, I've done so much additional work that customising my new keyboard was pretty much a breeze. My new keyboard is called Beebs. I'm currently using a 65% with stock Gateron Brown switches desoldered from Keebs while waiting for my new switches to come. Maybe I'll post my build in the future!

## Minor value-adding

If someone who's new to keyboard modding approached me, this would be the two things I'd say. I'm sure they're written on the internet. Except I missed it and learnt it the hard way.

### 1. Always test your PCB first. Always.

It's normal for bad wiring and soldering jobs to occur even for manufactured PCBs. Whenever you have a blank PCB, always test it first before you invest the time and effort that comes after. Had I checked beforehand, I could have saved a set of hand-lubed switches as well as the insane number of hours soldering/desoldering/lubing/troubleshooting.

### 2. There's no such thing as a perfect first-build.

It's part of the fun to experiment and mess things up. Don't spend too much effort looking into making the perfect first build. It doesn't exist. The easiest way is to simply start. You'll figure things out along the way. The next part of the fun is figuring out how to improve your current build. If you built the perfect board, there'd be nothing else left to do!

## Was it worth it?

### Noteworthy Moments

- Wallet feels lighter than before... Has anyone ever mentioned how expensive this hobby is?
- Broke Keebs.
- Decommissioned  Keebs has taken up the new management role of watching me from the other side of the table while I work.
- Gave the first set of switches (milky yellows) I've ever lubed to my colleague who refers to it as the (I kid you not) **wubalubadubdub**.
- Which gave me an excuse to build a new keyboard - Beebs.
- And spend more money.
- Became the keyboard "verties and hories guy" in the eyes of my brother and Sam. I've linked the video below, check it out it's pretty funny.

### Verdict

Yes, it was worth it. Very much so. I'm glad I made my big mistake.

## Where now?

I should get better at documentation. But that's it for this article. I made an instagram post so that I can share videos and images here. If it works, you'll see it below. (:

At the moment, I'm waiting for the parts to upgrade Beebs. A friend's birthday is also coming up and I'll be building a keyboard for them as a present. Let's hope said friend isn't reading this!

That's all for now. Toodles!
