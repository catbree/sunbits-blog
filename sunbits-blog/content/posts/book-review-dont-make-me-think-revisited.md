## Overview
This is Steve Krug, the person behind _Don't Make Me Think, Revisited_ (DMMT). Steve is a usability consultant who seems to really enjoy what he's doing. If I had to describe DMMT in three words, it would be: **honest-to-goodness**.

DMMT is a short book on web and mobile usability. It was originally published in 2000 and had since been updated twice, leading up to the third edition that we currently have today.

In summary, DMMT can be broken down into three main portions. The book starts off by sharing Steve's guiding principles and a reality check of how people actually use the web. The middle portion focuses on certain aspects of designing a website that would bring a lot of value when done right (or simply just done, in some cases). The book finishes with Steve discussing about the larger concerns and influences that he has about usability such as accessibility, mobile and usability practice adoptions at workplaces.

I found DMMT to be a very comfortable read. It's short and simple. It's filled with visuals and examples. And it's also pretty funny.

Now that I've covered the overview of the book, let's dive right into why I think should or shouldn't read the book.

## Why you should read this book

### It's simple and effective
For its small size, it sure brought a lot of volume. It has been pared-down to only include the most essential points that everyone should know when it comes to usability. It brings attention to some largely underestimated processes that will improve your website's usability in the long run. 

Steve Krug peppers advices such as this throughout the book:
> It's vital to have sample pages that show the navigation for all the potential levels of the site before you start arguing about the color scheme.

This would be a story for some other time, but let's just say I wholeheartedly agree and don't wish to commit the same crime again.

### It's not rocket surgery!
Small steps, guidance and encouragements are aplenty to get you started on implementing a process or improving an existing one. 

I'd like to specially highlight the chapter _Usability testing on 10 cents a day_. This section will be extremely useful for teams and individuals that have no idea how to start usability testing. Steve provides a lot of [accompanying materials](https://sensible.com/download-files/) such as scripts, checklists and demonstrations that can help you prepare for your sessions. 

Alternatively, if you're looking specifically into usability testing, consider reading [_Rocket Surgery Made Easy_](https://sensible.com/rocket-surgery-made-easy/) instead (also by Steve Krug).

### It's a good reminder
For those who actively work with improving usability in their day-to-day job, leafing through this book will serve as a good reminder of some key points that you should always remember. 

I enjoy this quote from the book:
> Usability is at its heart, a user advocate job: Like the Lorax, you speak for the trees. Well, the users, actually. Usability is about serving people better by building better products.

I try not to forget.

## Why this book may not be for you

### It's outdated
This was written in 2014 and since then, mobile has taken over the world! Changes were made to include mobile usability in the third edition by it's not nearly enough for our world today. A quick example would be scalable designs which was very briefly touched on. But with mobile access accounting for half of the world's web traffic today, scalable designs are generally a must in most cases.

Steve's talking about the edits he made for mobile usability with his witty humour:
> So I did three things:
> Included mobile examples wherever it made sense.
> Added a new chapter about some mobile-specific usability issues.
> And the most important one: Added "and Mobile" to the subtitle on the cover.

There are also many larger concerns and areas that came into prominence only after the third edition was published, such as voice technology and the general public adoption of other forms of customer touchpoints like self-order kiosks.

### It's not a specialised book
You're not the target audience if you're looking for something specific as this book was written to include anything under the usability sun. While it has useful bite-sized information on many areas of usability, you should look for something else if you're trying to learn specifically about accessibility, for example. There won't be enough to cover your interest.

## Why I think you should read the book anyway
Overall, I enjoyed the book very much and think it'll be a good casual read for anyone. The basic usability principles he set out are still extremely relevant today. While the context has changed, the fundamental reasons behind his principles remain largely unchallenged.
